With your knowledge of the codebase still in context memory if there are any changes you deem would improve an LLM's understanding of the codebase, or improvements for both maintainability, future proofing, expansion, and similar. This might include ensuring all files are speciifc to one action in classes to keep the codebase both easy and cheap for an llm to modify files in, helper functions and/or libraries whehr homegrown or from github or standard arch linux packages that may give a benenfit of anykind, and overall just thinking hard if this projects current state from top to bottom is as ironclad as possible under your models agentic abilities and understanding.
